# 🏙️ Seattle Airbnb Listings & Melbourne Housing Market Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects on two real-world datasets from Kaggle:

1. **Seattle Airbnb Listings** → Understanding property listings, pricing patterns, seasonality, and key factors influencing rental prices.  
2. **Melbourne Housing Market** → Analyzing housing prices, property features, and location-based trends in Melbourne.  

Both analyses demonstrate how **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** can be used to explore datasets, uncover insights, and visualize real estate market trends.
